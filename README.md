This app is the backend of a online store and has three views:
1. Customer view: The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. 
1. Manager view: The app adds new products and updates stock based on manager orders.
1. Supervisor view: The app tracks product sales across the store's departments and then provides a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

This command-line interface app uses JavaScript for the logic and MySQL to store data.
